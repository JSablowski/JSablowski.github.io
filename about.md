I'm a researcher/PhD student at the TU Dresden Institute of Process Engineering and Environmental Technology.

My research is focused on enhancing heat transfer via functionalized surfaces with special wettability. This includes dropwise condensation of non-aqueous fluids as well as fouling mitigation on heat exchanger surfaces.
