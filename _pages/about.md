I'm a researcher at the Measurement, Sensor and Embedded Systems Lab (MSE Lab) at TU Freiberg. Also finishing my PhD on enhanced heat transfer via dropwise condensation at TU Dresden.

My current research is focused on the detection of liquid and solid deposits on plate-like structures using ultrasonic guided waves. I have previously worked on research projects about dropwise condensation of water/steam, fouling resistant heat exchanger surfaces, and energy optimization of industrial processes.
